**YemekSepeti Homework**

## Intoduction
The application records the key value values sent with the http request, at the same time transfers these records to a file every 5000 ms, and continues its life by taking the records from this file when the application is closed and opened.


P.S: The file recording time parameter can be made parametric, but I didn't need it. I spent time on the topics specifically mentioned in the case content.

## Run

```
docker-compose up -d
```
